Nice.js extends JS syntax. You create less code. Code looks better
=======

I worked last years with python language. And when I tried to switch to node.js and create botch backed and frontend on JavaScript only - I found that JS lacks some cool features from other part of the World.

In this project I implement compiler from Nice.js syntax to plain JavaScript. I believe that you are using Underscore.js to simplify your coding life. I also use it, and in resulting code you will see Underscore.js syntax.

Resulting code is readable like your original code on Nice.js. We transform only short forms of code to full form of plain JS.


Syntax

You can find syntax description in folder [tests](/tests).
